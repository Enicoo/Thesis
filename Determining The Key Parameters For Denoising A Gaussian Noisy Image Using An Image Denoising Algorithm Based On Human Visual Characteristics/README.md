# Abstract
Image denoising presents challenges due to the innate variability among images. We proposed an image-denoising algorithm modelled after the human brain's ability to perform selective attention, reducing denoising strength based on the visibility of object edges. The strength of the denoising algorithm was controlled through the parameters of the perceived noise variable,  $X_Y$ and $X_C$. We determined the best-performing parameter for 30 images with $512 \times 512$ resolution affected by Gaussian noise with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 65. The performance of the denoising algorithm based on human visual characteristics was measured with the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). The parameter combinations: $X_Y = 128$ and $X_C = 512$, $X_Y = 256$ and $X_C = 512$, $X_Y = 512$ and $X_C = 512$, $X_Y = 768$ and $X_C = 512$, $X_Y = 1024$ and $X_C = 512$, $X_Y = 512$ and $X_C = 128$, $X_Y = 512$ and $X_C = 256$, $X_Y = 512$ and $X_C = 768$, $X_Y = 512$ and $X_C = 1024$, $X_Y = 128$ and $X_C = 1024$,  and $X_Y = 256$ and $X_C = 1024$ were used and the resulting SSIM scores were recorded and compared. Applying all the parameter combinations to each image, it was revealed that among the 30 images, 66.7\% showed that the best-performing parameter combination is $X_Y = 128$ and $X_C = 1024$
